## Submission

Instead of requiring you to submit your assignment before the due date, we will pull the latest
version from the shared repository. Your project should have a top level directory called **asgn**
which contains the following files:

- asgn2.c 
- mylib.c
- mylib.h
- tree.c
- tree.h

***

## Git

Please only add the above files to your repo when you're commiting your changes.

You can add an individual file by using the command <code>git add mylib.c</code>.

A good way to tell which file needs to be commited is by using <code>git status</code> and adding those changes.
